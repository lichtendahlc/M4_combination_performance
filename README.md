This repository contains code to reproduce the results in Lichtendahl and Winkler (2019) "Why Do Some Combinations Perform Better Than Others?" This paper proposes a combination method that is the trimmed mean of screened models. The base models screened and then combined are the nine base models from Montero-Manso et al.'s (2018) submission to the M4 competition. We apply to two screens to the nine base models--one screen based on accuracy (doing at least as well as the Naive2 benchmark model) and another screen based on diversity.
